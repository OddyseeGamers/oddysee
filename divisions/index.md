# STRATCOM

## Strategic and Tactical Combat Division

<div class="quote">
  "If it flies we fly after it, if it shoots we shoot back, if it persists, it dies. No target is
  too big or too small for STRATCOM."
</div>

### Mission Statement

> To provide unparalleled combative support to domestic and friendly allies. To shake the heavens
> upon our arrival in any engagement which Oddysee is involved, and to dominate the arena with sheer
> power, intelligence, and discipline.


STRATCOM is the combat division of Oddysee. If you're looking for excitement and like to live at the
end of a laser cannon, then STRATCOM is for you. From fighter combat to capital ships, space to
ground, STRATCOM covers all arenas of engagement. It exists and is organized on two principal
doctrines: Flexibility and Mobility

# LID

## Logistics and Intelligence Division

<div class="quote">
  "If we don't know it or have it, then we will find out and get it."
</div>


### Primary job

We gather knowledge and resources, that is our job. Its not glamorous, but we support the other
branches in intelligence and logistical support. We are the base that supports the PMC. We do what
needs to be done to get what we need to prosecute our missions. We are not a fighting branch save
for special cases, such as agents and ships who are on loan or work closely with tactical command.

Not unheard of to be in tactical and LIDCOM, example, fuelers, salvage ships, scouts, stealth ships
for gathering information on special cases requested by High Command, Operations Chiefs attached to
squadrons or squads in STRATCOM or by other commands such as tactical, recruitment, or training
commands.

Assets... Anything not fighting and acting in a support role falls under LID jurisdiction unless on
an On Loan status to a specific command. LID will support and direct resources to other commands as
requested, using any On loan status ships to a specific command before dispatching LID assets. We
will make sure the fuel gets to the support ships, or a tactical squadron gets a good pair of eyes
if requested.
