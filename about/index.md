# About Oddysee

The goal for Oddysee in the long term is to provide a 'base of operations' so to speak for games,
basically a community, the goal is to expand onto other games eventually and when your in those
games you will have the option of starting 'Oddysee' on that game following the same core
principals. All whilst making lifelong friends.

## Scope

Oddysee Scope extends past your typical gaming community, originally created as a 'rebirth' to the
founders old past clans in a attempt to bring both communities together, with roots in World of
Warcraft and the Call of duty Clan scene.

With this in mind Oddysee aims to have a diverse, large, yet tight knit community that has roots in
several different multiplayer games of all genres, be it FPS, MMORPG's, Space sims or the likes.
Oddysee aims to be different to other communities which take themselves seriously in terms of
rankings (Though it is a goal it is not as high up as the other aims.)

## Core Values

The core values of Oddysee are as follows:

* Fun
* Respect
* Give assistance wherever possible
* Be the best that we can be without sacrificing the aforementioned values

Each person will get out of this organisation only what they themselves are willing to accept and
what they themselves are willing to put in. This means within the community, and hopefully people
will acquire life long friends along the way.
