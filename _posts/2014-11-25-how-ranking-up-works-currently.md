title: How ranking up works currently
---
Oddysee believes in a merit based system, that means the more you contribute to
the org in the form of helping your fellow members, staying active and
contributing to the community the more likely a chance that you have to rank up
within the organisation.

We do not support ‘buying’ of ranks. That means you are judged by the way you
behave and the organisation will reward you accordingly. When you join oddysee
you are treated as every other member has been when they first joined. Do right
by your fellow members, be nominated for your deeds and you will climb the
ladder.

Kind regards  
Alasmon Necrithious  
Organisation Leader
