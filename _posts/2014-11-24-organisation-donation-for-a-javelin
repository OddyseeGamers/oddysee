title: Organisation donation for a Javelin!
---
Due to rather vocal statement by some org members, we have decided to open up a
organisation pot for the ‘crowdfunding’ Donations of a Javelin for the
organisation.

What this means is that it should be treated as if you were donating for
anything else you would in person, it is meant to enhance the experience for the
organisation as a whole. Should you wish to donate please contact cainsrebel
with your email address and able to pledge amount.

e.g.

Name: Alasmon Necrithious
Pledge amount: $xxx
Email: cykhat@hotmail.com
Queries: Please put any queries you might have in regards to this here.
You can do this via: cainsrebel@gmail.com

Remember though you are donating it does not mean you will be the pilot for it
as I hope you will understand. This is not something that is imperative for the
organisation survival and is just more for a bit of fun and a team building
exercise. If you can contribute and you wish to do so please feel free to do so.
You are under no obligation to contribute large sums or at all for that matter.

We need to try to finalise the amounts we have by the 26/11/2014 so that we can
work out money transfers (either via gift cards or paypal) and finalise details
before getting money together for the Javelin Destroyer (should we meet goal).

Kind regards
Alasmon Necrithious  
Organisation Leader
